This repository contains code and data for the Texas Coastal Nutrient
Input Repository project. This project develops estimates of actual and
flow-normalized daily nitrate (NO<sup>3</sup>-N) and total phosphorus
(TP) watershed loads. Reports and publications are forthcoming.

Data analysis and models were developed in R using the
[renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) and
[targets](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) R packages to facilitate
reproducibility. To reproduce this analysis clone the repository to your
local machine, ensure both renv and targets are installed and open the
project. The analysis can be reproduced using:

``` r
renv::restore()
targets::tar_make()
```
