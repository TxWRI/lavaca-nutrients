The modeled data are derived simulating the TxRR model and not included diversion and return flow information. The subfolders include the modeled, diversion, and return flow datafiles.

• The data are expressed in daily time step with acre-feet unit scale. 
• The datafiles may have the values for different period of record.
• Data may not be available for all sub-watersheds, such as Diversion flow data.
• Modeled data are not available for 16014 sub-watershed as this is gauged and the data have been derived from Lake Texana gauging station.
