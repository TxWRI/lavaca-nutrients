    Two statistical approaches, weighted regression on time, discharge, and
    season and generalized additive models, have recently been used to evaluate
    water quality trends in estuaries. Both models have been used in similar
    contexts despite differences in statistical foundations and products. This
    study provided an empirical and qualitative comparison of both models using
    29 years of data for two discrete time series of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) in
    the Patuxent River estuary. Empirical descriptions of each model were based
    on predictive performance against the observed data, ability to reproduce
    ﬂow-normalized trends with simulated data, and comparisons of performance
    with validation datasets. Between-model differences were apparent but minor
    and both models had comparable abilities to remove ﬂow effects from
    simulated time series. Both models similarly predicted observations for
    missing data with different characteristics. Trends from each model revealed
    distinct mainstem inﬂuences of the Chesapeake Bay with both models
    predicting a roughly 65% increase in chl-a over time in the lower estuary,
    whereas ﬂow-normalized predictions for the upper estuary showed a more
    dynamic pattern, with a nearly 100% increase in chl-a in the last 10 years.
    Qualitative comparisons highlighted important differences in the statistical
    structure, available products, and characteristics of the data and desired
    analysis.

    Pollution with nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) impairs streams by favoring
    suspended algae and cyanobacteria over diatom-rich periphyton. Recently,
    wastewater treatment plants have been upgraded to biological nutrient
    removal to eliminate both P and N (mainly NH4+), although little is known of
    the effects of this efﬂuent on ﬂowing waters. Here, we used high performance
    liquid chromatography to quantify how the abundance and composition of
    phytoplankton and periphyton varied in response to both inﬂux of efﬂuent
    produced by biological nutrient removal and physico-chemical conditions in
    small, turbid, P-rich streams of the northern Great Plains. At the catchment
    scale, analysis with generalized additive models (GAMs) explained 40.5–62.6%
    of deviance in total phototroph abundance (as Chl a) and 72.5–82.5% of
    deviance in community composition (as biomarker carotenoids) in both
    planktonic and benthic habitats when date- and site-speciﬁc physico-chemical
    parameters were used as predictors. In contrast, GAMs using wastewater input
    (as aqueous δ15N) as a predictor explained up to 50% of deviance in Chl a,
    and ~60% of deviance in community composition, in both suspended (51.6% of
    Chl a, 67.1% of composition) and attached communities (21.5% of Chl a, 58.8%
    of composition). Phytoplankton was replaced by periphyton within a 60-km
    wastewater-impacted reach due to dilution of streams by transparent efﬂuent
    and addition of urban NO3À, although predominance of phytoplankton was
    re-established after conﬂuence with higher-order streams. Overall, inﬂux of
    efﬂuent shifted turbid, phytoplankton-rich streams to clear ecosystems with
    abundant epilithon by improving water transparency and providing NO3À to
    favor benthic diatoms and chlorophytes.

    Coastal watersheds in Texas have experienced signiﬁcant human population
    growth over the past several decades, yet there have been no comprehensive
    assessments of water quality trends in Texas estuaries. Here, analysis of
    historical estuarine water quality data indicates regional “hot spots” of
    change. Galveston Bay and Oso Bay, which have highly urbanized watersheds,
    currently exhibit symptoms of eutrophication. Symptoms of eutrophication
    were also found in the Baﬃn Bay-Upper Laguna Madre complex, which has a
    sparsely populated but agriculturally-intensive watershed. Increasing
    salinity was observed in estuaries of the central Texas coast and are
    attributed to long-term decreases in freshwater inﬂow. Another artifact of
    decreasing freshwater inﬂow is a reduction in the delivery of carbonate
    minerals to estuaries, which manifests as decreases in pH. With ﬁndings from
    this study, targeted studies can now be directed at the estuaries that are
    experiencing water quality degradation in order to guide future management
    eﬀorts.

  abstract: "Abstract\n            Understanding the lag time between land management and impacts on riverine nitrate–nitrogen (N) loads is critical to understand when action to mitigate nitrate–N leaching losses from the soil profile may start improving water quality. These lags occur due to leaching of nitrate–N through the subsurface (soil and groundwater). Actions to mitigate nitrate–N losses have been mandated in New Zealand policy to start showing improvements in water quality within five years. We estimated annual rates of nitrate–N leaching and annual nitrate–N loads for 77 river catchments from 1990 to 2018. Lag times between these losses and riverine loads\_were determined for 34 catchments but could not be determined in other catchments because they exhibited little change in nitrate–N leaching losses or loads. Lag times varied from 1 to 12\_years according to factors like catchment size (Strahler stream order and altitude) and slope. For eight catchments where additional\_isotope and modelling data were available, the mean transit time for surface water at baseflow to pass through the catchment was on average 2.1\_years less than, and never greater than, the mean lag time for nitrate–N, inferring our lag time estimates were robust. The median lag time for nitrate–N across the 34 catchments was 4.5\_years, meaning that nearly half of these catchments wouldn’t exhibit decreases in nitrate–N because of practice change within the five years outlined in policy."

    Due to the lack of water quality data in the lower watersheds of the Texas
    coastal region, a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) version 2009 model
    was used to estimate terrestrial sediment and nutrient loads from non-tidal
    fresh water inflows to Texas bays in this study. The Texas Water Development
    Board (TWDB) has used the TxRR (Texas Rainfall-Runoff) model to estimate the
    total fresh water inflow and annual sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus loads
    from measured and simulated stream flows to the bays in Texas. Applying
    newer methods, such as distributed hydrologic models, e.g., SWAT, enables
    the temporal and spatial distribution of freshwater, sediment, and nutrient
    loads to also be predicted. To develop the SWAT model for the estimation of
    sediment and nutrient loads from two watersheds, the Matagorda as a rural
    watershed and Galveston as an urbanized watershed, the average of the
    calibrated model parameter values were applied to the ungauged lower
    sub-watersheds in consideration of land use homogeneity.

    SPAtially Referenced Regressions On Watershed attributes (SPARROW) models
    were developed to estimate nutrient inputs [total nitrogen (TN) and total
    phosphorus (TP)] to the northwestern part of the Gulf of Mexico from streams
    in the South-Central United States (U.S.). This area included drainages of
    the Lower Mississippi, Arkansas-White-Red, and Texas-Gulf hydrologic
    regions. The models were standardized to reﬂect nutrient sources and stream
    conditions during 2002. Model predictions of nutrient loads (mass per time)
    and yields (mass per area per time) generally were greatest in streams in
    the eastern part of the region and along reaches near the Texas and
    Louisiana shoreline. The Mississippi River and Atchafalaya River watersheds,
    which drain nearly two-thirds of the conterminous U.S., delivered the
    largest nutrient loads to the Gulf of Mexico, as expected. However, the
    three largest delivered TN yields were from the Trinity River ⁄ Galveston
    Bay, Calcasieu River, and Aransas River watersheds, while the three largest
    delivered TP yields were from the Calcasieu River, Mermentau River, and
    Trinity River ⁄ Galveston Bay watersheds. Model output indicated that the
    three largest sources of nitrogen from the region were atmospheric
    deposition (42%), commercial fertilizer (20%), and livestock manure
    (unconﬁned, 17%). The three largest sources of phosphorus were commercial
    fertilizer (28%), urban runoff (23%), and livestock manure (conﬁned and
    unconﬁned, 23%).

    A Generalised Additive Modelling (GAM) approach is applied to prediction of
    both particulate and dissolved nutrient concentrations in a wet-tropical
    river (the Fitzroy River, Queensland, Australia). In addition to covariant
    terms considered in previous work (i.e. ﬂow, discounted ﬂow and a
    rising-falling limb term), we considered several new potential covariates:
    meteorological and hydrological variables that are routinely monitored,
    available in near-real time, and were considered to have potential
    predictive power. Of the additional terms considered, only ﬂows from three
    tributaries of the Fitzroy River (namely, the Nogoa, Comet and Isaac Rivers)
    were found to signiﬁcantly improve the model. Inclusion of one or more of
    these additional ﬂow terms greatly improved results for dissolved nitrogen
    and dissolved phosphorus concentrations, which were not otherwise amenable
    to prediction. In particular, the Nogoa sub-catchment, dominated by pasture
    for cattle, was found to be important in determining dissolved inorganic
    nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations reaching the river mouth. This
    insight may direct further research, including future reﬁnement of
    processed-based catchment models. The GAMs described here are used to
    provide near real-time river boundary conditions for a complex coupled
    hydrodynamic and biogeochemical model of the Great Barrier Reef Lagoon, and
    can be coupled with a forecasting hydrological model to allow integrated
    forecasting simulations of the catchment to coast system.

  abstract: >-
    Regression-based approaches are often employed to estimate riverine
    constituent concentrations and ﬂuxes based on typically sparse concentration
    observations. One such approach is the recently developed WRTDS (‘‘Weighted
    Regressions on Time, Discharge, and Season”) method, which has been shown to
    provide more accurate estimates than prior approaches in a wide range of
    applications. Centered on WRTDS, this work was aimed at developing improved
    models for constituent concentration and ﬂux estimation by accounting for
    antecedent discharge conditions. Twelve modiﬁed models were developed and
    tested, each of which contains one additional ﬂow variable to represent
    antecedent conditions and which can be directly derived from the daily
    discharge record. High-resolution ($daily) data at nine diverse monitoring
    sites were used to evaluate the relative merits of the models for estimation
    of six constituents – chloride (Cl), nitrate-plus-nitrite (NOx), total
    Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), total phosphorus (TP), soluble reactive phosphorus
    (SRP), and suspended sediment (SS). For each site-constituent combination,
    30 concentration subsets were generated from the original data through Monte
    Carlo subsampling and then used to evaluate model performance. For the
    subsampling, three sampling strategies were adopted: (A) 1 random sample
    each month (12/year), (B) 12 random monthly samples plus additional 8 random
    samples per year (20/ year), and (C) ﬂow-stratiﬁed sampling with 12 regular
    (non-storm) and 8 storm samples per year (20/ year). Results reveal that
    estimation performance varies with both model choice and sampling strategy.
    In terms of model choice, the modiﬁed models show general improvement over
    the original model under all three sampling strategies. Major improvements
    were achieved for NOx by the long-term ﬂow-anomaly model and for Cl by the
    ADF (average discounted ﬂow) model and the short-term ﬂow-anomaly model.
    Moderate improvements were achieved for SS, TP, and TKN by the ADF model. By
    contrast, no such achievement was achieved for SRP by any proposed model. In
    terms of sampling strategy, performance of all models (including the
    original) was generally best using strategy C and worst using strategy A,
    and especially so for SS, TP, and SRP, conﬁrming the value of routinely
    collecting stormﬂow samples. Overall, this work provides a comprehensive set
    of statistical evidence for supporting the incorporation of antecedent
    discharge conditions into the WRTDS model for estimation of constituent
    concentration and ﬂux, thereby combining the advantages of two recent
    developments in water quality modeling.
