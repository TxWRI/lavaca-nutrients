    Two statistical approaches, weighted regression on time, discharge, and
    season and generalized additive models, have recently been used to evaluate
    water quality trends in estuaries. Both models have been used in similar
    contexts despite differences in statistical foundations and products. This
    study provided an empirical and qualitative comparison of both models using
    29 years of data for two discrete time series of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) in
    the Patuxent River estuary. Empirical descriptions of each model were based
    on predictive performance against the observed data, ability to reproduce
    ﬂow-normalized trends with simulated data, and comparisons of performance
    with validation datasets. Between-model differences were apparent but minor
    and both models had comparable abilities to remove ﬂow effects from
    simulated time series. Both models similarly predicted observations for
    missing data with different characteristics. Trends from each model revealed
    distinct mainstem inﬂuences of the Chesapeake Bay with both models
    predicting a roughly 65% increase in chl-a over time in the lower estuary,
    whereas ﬂow-normalized predictions for the upper estuary showed a more
    dynamic pattern, with a nearly 100% increase in chl-a in the last 10 years.
    Qualitative comparisons highlighted important differences in the statistical
    structure, available products, and characteristics of the data and desired
    analysis.

    Eutrophication has re-emerged in the lower Great Lakes basin resulting in
    critical water quality issues. Models that accurately predict nutrient
    loading from streams are needed to inform appropriate nutrient management
    decisions. Generalized additive models (GAMs) that use surrogate data from
    sensors to predict nutrient loads offer an alternative to commonly applied
    linear regression and may better handle relationship non-linearities and
    skewed water quality data. Five years (2015–2020) of water quantity and
    quality data from 11 agricultural watersheds in southern Ontario were used
    to develop GAMs to predict total phosphorus (TP) and nitrate (NO3−) loads.
    This study aimed to 1) use GAMs to predict nutrient loads using both common
    and novel predictors and 2) quantify and examine the variability in seasonal
    and annual nutrient loads. Along with routine surrogate model predictors
    (i.e., ﬂow, turbidity, and seasonality), the addition of the baseﬂow
    proportion and the hydrograph position of ﬂow observations improved model
    performance. Conversely, including the antecedent precipitation index
    minimally affected model performance, regardless of constituent. Seasonal
    and annual patterns in TP and NO3− load predictions mirrored that of the
    hydrologic regime. This study showed that parsimonious GAMs featuring novel
    model predictors can be used to predict nutrient loads while accounting for
    the partitioning of surface and subsurface ﬂow paths and hysteresis between
    streamﬂow and water quality parameters that are frequently observed in a
    wide range of environments.

    Coastal watersheds in Texas have experienced signiﬁcant human population
    growth over the past several decades, yet there have been no comprehensive
    assessments of water quality trends in Texas estuaries. Here, analysis of
    historical estuarine water quality data indicates regional “hot spots” of
    change. Galveston Bay and Oso Bay, which have highly urbanized watersheds,
    currently exhibit symptoms of eutrophication. Symptoms of eutrophication
    were also found in the Baﬃn Bay-Upper Laguna Madre complex, which has a
    sparsely populated but agriculturally-intensive watershed. Increasing
    salinity was observed in estuaries of the central Texas coast and are
    attributed to long-term decreases in freshwater inﬂow. Another artifact of
    decreasing freshwater inﬂow is a reduction in the delivery of carbonate
    minerals to estuaries, which manifests as decreases in pH. With ﬁndings from
    this study, targeted studies can now be directed at the estuaries that are
    experiencing water quality degradation in order to guide future management
    eﬀorts.

  abstract: >-
    The root:shoot ratio of grassland plants may be lower in high fertility
    sites than in low fertility sites as plants modify their root, rhizome and
    shoot morphologies (and masses) to suit prevailing nutrient availability. We
    conducted geographically diverse and regionally specific field sampling and
    measured above- and belowground plant biomasses in western Atlantic and Gulf
    of Mexico salt marshes to determine whether there is a similar morphological
    response in Spartina alterniflora, the dominant salt marsh plant. Coastal
    nutrient addition/enrichment, which is widespread and ongoing, may lower
    root and rhizome biomass, belowground production and organic accumulation in
    this species. Higher soil respiration and a lower Eh (redox potential) are
    expected additional soil property changes. The addition of P, more than of
    N, seems to reduce root and rhizome biomass accumulation. The cumulative
    effects of increased nutrient loadings on salt marshes may be to decrease
    soil elevation and accelerate the conversion of emergent plant habitat to
    open water, particularly on the lower marsh. The recommendations for
    management practices intended to conserve coastal marshes include reducing
    nutrient loading to coastal zones, solving water quality problems with a
    multiple nutrient approach, and choosing monitoring metrics that are based
    on both above- and belowground plant biomass.

    This study investigated the impact of model form and flexibility on
    estimates of constituent loads to a water-supply reservoir. A series of
    load-estimation regression models were calibrated and used to predict
    nutrient (nitrate-nitrogen and total phosphorus) and organic carbon loads
    from three major tributaries of a water-supply reservoir. These models
    included traditional linear models (LMs) as well as semiparametric
    generalized additive models (GAMs). The relative performance of each model
    was determined using cross-validation. GAMs, which employ more flexible
    model structures, outperformed LMs in most cases, explaining an additional
    2% of load variance and 5% of concentration variance in validation data on
    average. Resulting point load estimates from the 1.5-year study period were
    similar between the two modeling approaches, yielding overlapping 95%
    confidence intervals in all nine cases modeled. A novel graphical method was
    developed to present relative agreement between the two model types as a
    function of the time interval over which the load is estimated. This
    revealed relative differences between the two modeling approaches in excess
    of 100% depending on the time interval of the load estimate. The
    timedependent disagreement between similarly well-performing models
    highlights an aspect of model uncertainty not visible in more structurally
    restrictive modeling approaches. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)EE.1943-7870.0001077. ©

    A new approach to the analysis of long-term surface water-quality data is
    proposed and implemented. The goal of this approach is to increase the
    amount of information that is extracted from the types of rich water-quality
    datasets that now exist. The method is formulated to allow for maximum
    ﬂexibility in representations of the long-term trend, seasonal components,
    and discharge-related components of the behavior of the water-quality
    variable of interest. It is designed to provide internally consistent
    estimates of the actual history of concentrations and ﬂuxes as well as
    histories that eliminate the inﬂuence of year-to-year variations in
    streamﬂow. The method employs the use of weighted regressions of
    concentrations on time, discharge, and season. Finally, the method is
    designed to be useful as a diagnostic tool regarding the kinds of changes
    that are taking place in the watershed related to point sources, groundwater
    sources, and surface-water nonpoint sources. The method is applied to
    datasets for the nine large tributaries of Chesapeake Bay from 1978 to 2008.
    The results show a wide range of patterns of change in total phosphorus and
    in dissolved nitrate plus nitrite. These results should prove useful in
    further examination of the causes of changes, or lack of changes, and may
    help inform decisions about future actions to reduce nutrient enrichment in
    the Chesapeake Bay and its watershed.

  abstract: "Abstract\n            Understanding the lag time between land management and impacts on riverine nitrate–nitrogen (N) loads is critical to understand when action to mitigate nitrate–N leaching losses from the soil profile may start improving water quality. These lags occur due to leaching of nitrate–N through the subsurface (soil and groundwater). Actions to mitigate nitrate–N losses have been mandated in New Zealand policy to start showing improvements in water quality within five years. We estimated annual rates of nitrate–N leaching and annual nitrate–N loads for 77 river catchments from 1990 to 2018. Lag times between these losses and riverine loads\_were determined for 34 catchments but could not be determined in other catchments because they exhibited little change in nitrate–N leaching losses or loads. Lag times varied from 1 to 12\_years according to factors like catchment size (Strahler stream order and altitude) and slope. For eight catchments where additional\_isotope and modelling data were available, the mean transit time for surface water at baseflow to pass through the catchment was on average 2.1\_years less than, and never greater than, the mean lag time for nitrate–N, inferring our lag time estimates were robust. The median lag time for nitrate–N across the 34 catchments was 4.5\_years, meaning that nearly half of these catchments wouldn’t exhibit decreases in nitrate–N because of practice change within the five years outlined in policy."

  abstract: >-
    Long-term trends in the response of benthic macrofauna to hydrological
    conditions were examined in the Lavaca-Colorado Estuary, Texas. Four
    stations representing a range of salinities in the Lavaca-Colorado Estuary
    were sampled quarterly for benthic macrofauna and hydrography from April
    1988 to October 2008. The relationship between climate variability and local
    salinity patterns and benthic populations was investigated using the Oceanic
    Niño Index (ONI), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and North Pacific Index
    (NPI). Mean salinity declined during the 20 yr study period. Observed
    changes in salinity were related to river discharge and the ONI because
    there were more El Niño events in the first half of the study period
    relative to the second half. Benthic macrofaunal abundance was significantly
    correlated with salinity, the ONI and the NAO, indicating that global
    climate variability and the resulting effects on local salinity patterns are
    important factors shaping benthic macrofaunal communities. There was no
    significant linear trend in temperature over time, and negative correlations
    between individual taxa and temperature were likely due to seasonality.
    While drivers other than physical hydrological factors can obviously affect
    benthic macrofaunal communities, strong connections between global climate
    signals, precipitation, and local salinity patterns provided the most
    plausible mechanistic connection between climatic variability and benthic
    macrofaunal response in the estuary. An increasingly unstable climate may
    lead to potentially strong effects in estuarine ecosystems because stability
    is known to affect diversity and productivity. The vulnerability of
    estuarine ecosystems to the effects of climate variability will be
    exacerbated as human population growth and water resource development
    continues to increase the demand for and stress on coastal and marine
    resources.

    A Generalised Additive Modelling (GAM) approach is applied to prediction of
    both particulate and dissolved nutrient concentrations in a wet-tropical
    river (the Fitzroy River, Queensland, Australia). In addition to covariant
    terms considered in previous work (i.e. ﬂow, discounted ﬂow and a
    rising-falling limb term), we considered several new potential covariates:
    meteorological and hydrological variables that are routinely monitored,
    available in near-real time, and were considered to have potential
    predictive power. Of the additional terms considered, only ﬂows from three
    tributaries of the Fitzroy River (namely, the Nogoa, Comet and Isaac Rivers)
    were found to signiﬁcantly improve the model. Inclusion of one or more of
    these additional ﬂow terms greatly improved results for dissolved nitrogen
    and dissolved phosphorus concentrations, which were not otherwise amenable
    to prediction. In particular, the Nogoa sub-catchment, dominated by pasture
    for cattle, was found to be important in determining dissolved inorganic
    nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations reaching the river mouth. This
    insight may direct further research, including future reﬁnement of
    processed-based catchment models. The GAMs described here are used to
    provide near real-time river boundary conditions for a complex coupled
    hydrodynamic and biogeochemical model of the Great Barrier Reef Lagoon, and
    can be coupled with a forecasting hydrological model to allow integrated
    forecasting simulations of the catchment to coast system.

    We consider estimating the total load from frequent ﬂow data but less
    frequent concentration data. There are numerous load estimation methods
    available, some of which are captured in various online tools. However, most
    estimators are subject to large biases statistically, and their associated
    uncertainties are often not reported. This makes interpretation difﬁcult and
    the estimation of trends or determination of optimal sampling regimes
    impossible to assess. In this paper, we ﬁrst propose two indices for
    measuring the extent of sampling bias, and then provide steps for obtaining
    reliable load estimates that minimizes the biases and makes use of
    informative predictive variables. The key step to this approach is in the
    development of an appropriate predictive model for concentration. This is
    achieved using a generalized rating-curve approach with additional
    predictors that capture unique features in the ﬂow data, such as the concept
    of the ﬁrst ﬂush, the location of the event on the hydrograph (e.g. rise or
    fall) and the discounted ﬂow. The latter may be thought of as a measure of
    constituent exhaustion occurring during ﬂood events. Forming this additional
    information can signiﬁcantly improve the predictability of concentration,
    and ultimately the precision with which the pollutant load is estimated. We
    also provide a measure of the standard error of the load estimate which
    incorporates model, spatial and/or temporal errors. This method also has the
    capacity to incorporate measurement error incurred through the sampling of
    ﬂow. We illustrate this approach for two rivers delivering to the Great
    Barrier Reef, Queensland, Australia. One is a data set from the Burdekin
    River, and consists of the total suspended sediment (TSS) and nitrogen oxide
    (NOx) and gauged ﬂow for 1997. The other dataset is from the Tully River,
    for the period of July 2000 to June 2008. For NOx Burdekin, the new
    estimates are very similar to the ratio estimates even when there is no
    relationship between the concentration and the ﬂow. However, for the Tully
    dataset, by incorporating the additional predictive variables namely the
    discounted ﬂow and ﬂow phases (rising or recessing), we substantially
    improved the model ﬁt, and thus the certainty with which the load is
    estimated. Crown Copyright Ó 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights

    Studies of estuarine eutrophication have tended to focus on systems with
    continually flowing rivers, while little is known about estuaries from
    semi-arid/arid regions. Here we report results from an assessment of water
    quality conditions in Baffin Bay, Texas, a shallow (<2e3 m) subtropical
    estuary located in a semi-arid region that has agriculture as the dominant
    (44%) watershed land use. Chlorophyll a averaged 28e30 mg/l in Baffin Bay
    from 2003 to 2013 and total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) concentrations were also
    very high (116e120 mM), with concentrations of both variables exceeding
    those of most other Texas estuaries by 2e5 fold. More recent field sampling
    (2013e2015) showed that dissolved organic nitrogen concentrations in Baffin
    Bay (62 ± 14 mM) were >2 fold higher than in three other Texas estuaries. In
    contrast, inorganic nitrogen (ammonium, nitrate) and phosphate
    concentrations were relatively low. Statistically significant long-term
    annual increases in chlorophyll a and salinity were observed in Baffin Bay,
    while long-term seasonal increases were observed for water temperature and
    TKN. Overall, Baffin Bay is displaying multiple symptoms of eutrophication,
    namely very high organic carbon, organic nitrogen and chlorophyll
    concentrations, as well as symptoms not quantified here such as fish kills
    and episodic hypoxia. Much of the increase in chlorophyll in Baffin Bay, at
    least since \~1990, have coincided with blooms of the mixotrophic
    phytoplankton species, Aureoumbra lagunensis, which is thought to be favored
    under high proportions of organic to inorganic nitrogen. Thus the high and
    possibly increasing organic nitrogen concentrations, coupled with a
    long-term annual increase in salinity and a long-term seasonal increase in
    water temperature are likely to promote additional brown tide blooms in this
    system in the future.

    Regression-based approaches are often employed to estimate riverine
    constituent concentrations and ﬂuxes based on typically sparse concentration
    observations. One such approach is the recently developed WRTDS (‘‘Weighted
    Regressions on Time, Discharge, and Season”) method, which has been shown to
    provide more accurate estimates than prior approaches in a wide range of
    applications. Centered on WRTDS, this work was aimed at developing improved
    models for constituent concentration and ﬂux estimation by accounting for
    antecedent discharge conditions. Twelve modiﬁed models were developed and
    tested, each of which contains one additional ﬂow variable to represent
    antecedent conditions and which can be directly derived from the daily
    discharge record. High-resolution ($daily) data at nine diverse monitoring
    sites were used to evaluate the relative merits of the models for estimation
    of six constituents – chloride (Cl), nitrate-plus-nitrite (NOx), total
    Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), total phosphorus (TP), soluble reactive phosphorus
    (SRP), and suspended sediment (SS). For each site-constituent combination,
    30 concentration subsets were generated from the original data through Monte
    Carlo subsampling and then used to evaluate model performance. For the
    subsampling, three sampling strategies were adopted: (A) 1 random sample
    each month (12/year), (B) 12 random monthly samples plus additional 8 random
    samples per year (20/ year), and (C) ﬂow-stratiﬁed sampling with 12 regular
    (non-storm) and 8 storm samples per year (20/ year). Results reveal that
    estimation performance varies with both model choice and sampling strategy.
    In terms of model choice, the modiﬁed models show general improvement over
    the original model under all three sampling strategies. Major improvements
    were achieved for NOx by the long-term ﬂow-anomaly model and for Cl by the
    ADF (average discounted ﬂow) model and the short-term ﬂow-anomaly model.
    Moderate improvements were achieved for SS, TP, and TKN by the ADF model. By
    contrast, no such achievement was achieved for SRP by any proposed model. In
    terms of sampling strategy, performance of all models (including the
    original) was generally best using strategy C and worst using strategy A,
    and especially so for SS, TP, and SRP, conﬁrming the value of routinely
    collecting stormﬂow samples. Overall, this work provides a comprehensive set
    of statistical evidence for supporting the incorporation of antecedent
    discharge conditions into the WRTDS model for estimation of constituent
    concentration and ﬂux, thereby combining the advantages of two recent
    developments in water quality modeling.
