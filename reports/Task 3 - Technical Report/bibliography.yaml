  abstract: >-
    Coastal watersheds in Texas have experienced signiﬁcant human population
    growth over the past several decades, yet there have been no comprehensive
    assessments of water quality trends in Texas estuaries. Here, analysis of
    historical estuarine water quality data indicates regional “hot spots” of
    change. Galveston Bay and Oso Bay, which have highly urbanized watersheds,
    currently exhibit symptoms of eutrophication. Symptoms of eutrophication
    were also found in the Baﬃn Bay-Upper Laguna Madre complex, which has a
    sparsely populated but agriculturally-intensive watershed. Increasing
    salinity was observed in estuaries of the central Texas coast and are
    attributed to long-term decreases in freshwater inﬂow. Another artifact of
    decreasing freshwater inﬂow is a reduction in the delivery of carbonate
    minerals to estuaries, which manifests as decreases in pH. With ﬁndings from
    this study, targeted studies can now be directed at the estuaries that are
    experiencing water quality degradation in order to guide future management
    eﬀorts.

  abstract: >-
    The root:shoot ratio of grassland plants may be lower in high fertility
    sites than in low fertility sites as plants modify their root, rhizome and
    shoot morphologies (and masses) to suit prevailing nutrient availability. We
    conducted geographically diverse and regionally specific field sampling and
    measured above- and belowground plant biomasses in western Atlantic and Gulf
    of Mexico salt marshes to determine whether there is a similar morphological
    response in Spartina alterniflora, the dominant salt marsh plant. Coastal
    nutrient addition/enrichment, which is widespread and ongoing, may lower
    root and rhizome biomass, belowground production and organic accumulation in
    this species. Higher soil respiration and a lower Eh (redox potential) are
    expected additional soil property changes. The addition of P, more than of
    N, seems to reduce root and rhizome biomass accumulation. The cumulative
    effects of increased nutrient loadings on salt marshes may be to decrease
    soil elevation and accelerate the conversion of emergent plant habitat to
    open water, particularly on the lower marsh. The recommendations for
    management practices intended to conserve coastal marshes include reducing
    nutrient loading to coastal zones, solving water quality problems with a
    multiple nutrient approach, and choosing monitoring metrics that are based
    on both above- and belowground plant biomass.

  abstract: >-
    A new approach to the analysis of long-term surface water-quality data is
    proposed and implemented. The goal of this approach is to increase the
    amount of information that is extracted from the types of rich water-quality
    datasets that now exist. The method is formulated to allow for maximum
    ﬂexibility in representations of the long-term trend, seasonal components,
    and discharge-related components of the behavior of the water-quality
    variable of interest. It is designed to provide internally consistent
    estimates of the actual history of concentrations and ﬂuxes as well as
    histories that eliminate the inﬂuence of year-to-year variations in
    streamﬂow. The method employs the use of weighted regressions of
    concentrations on time, discharge, and season. Finally, the method is
    designed to be useful as a diagnostic tool regarding the kinds of changes
    that are taking place in the watershed related to point sources, groundwater
    sources, and surface-water nonpoint sources. The method is applied to
    datasets for the nine large tributaries of Chesapeake Bay from 1978 to 2008.
    The results show a wide range of patterns of change in total phosphorus and
    in dissolved nitrate plus nitrite. These results should prove useful in
    further examination of the causes of changes, or lack of changes, and may
    help inform decisions about future actions to reduce nutrient enrichment in
    the Chesapeake Bay and its watershed.

  abstract: >-
    Long-term trends in the response of benthic macrofauna to hydrological
    conditions were examined in the Lavaca-Colorado Estuary, Texas. Four
    stations representing a range of salinities in the Lavaca-Colorado Estuary
    were sampled quarterly for benthic macrofauna and hydrography from April
    1988 to October 2008. The relationship between climate variability and local
    salinity patterns and benthic populations was investigated using the Oceanic
    Niño Index (ONI), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and North Pacific Index
    (NPI). Mean salinity declined during the 20 yr study period. Observed
    changes in salinity were related to river discharge and the ONI because
    there were more El Niño events in the first half of the study period
    relative to the second half. Benthic macrofaunal abundance was significantly
    correlated with salinity, the ONI and the NAO, indicating that global
    climate variability and the resulting effects on local salinity patterns are
    important factors shaping benthic macrofaunal communities. There was no
    significant linear trend in temperature over time, and negative correlations
    between individual taxa and temperature were likely due to seasonality.
    While drivers other than physical hydrological factors can obviously affect
    benthic macrofaunal communities, strong connections between global climate
    signals, precipitation, and local salinity patterns provided the most
    plausible mechanistic connection between climatic variability and benthic
    macrofaunal response in the estuary. An increasingly unstable climate may
    lead to potentially strong effects in estuarine ecosystems because stability
    is known to affect diversity and productivity. The vulnerability of
    estuarine ecosystems to the effects of climate variability will be
    exacerbated as human population growth and water resource development
    continues to increase the demand for and stress on coastal and marine
    resources.

  abstract: >-
    Studies of estuarine eutrophication have tended to focus on systems with
    continually flowing rivers, while little is known about estuaries from
    semi-arid/arid regions. Here we report results from an assessment of water
    quality conditions in Baffin Bay, Texas, a shallow (<2e3 m) subtropical
    estuary located in a semi-arid region that has agriculture as the dominant
    (44%) watershed land use. Chlorophyll a averaged 28e30 mg/l in Baffin Bay
    from 2003 to 2013 and total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) concentrations were also
    very high (116e120 mM), with concentrations of both variables exceeding
    those of most other Texas estuaries by 2e5 fold. More recent field sampling
    (2013e2015) showed that dissolved organic nitrogen concentrations in Baffin
    Bay (62 ± 14 mM) were >2 fold higher than in three other Texas estuaries. In
    contrast, inorganic nitrogen (ammonium, nitrate) and phosphate
    concentrations were relatively low. Statistically significant long-term
    annual increases in chlorophyll a and salinity were observed in Baffin Bay,
    while long-term seasonal increases were observed for water temperature and
    TKN. Overall, Baffin Bay is displaying multiple symptoms of eutrophication,
    namely very high organic carbon, organic nitrogen and chlorophyll
    concentrations, as well as symptoms not quantified here such as fish kills
    and episodic hypoxia. Much of the increase in chlorophyll in Baffin Bay, at
    least since \~1990, have coincided with blooms of the mixotrophic
    phytoplankton species, Aureoumbra lagunensis, which is thought to be favored
    under high proportions of organic to inorganic nitrogen. Thus the high and
    possibly increasing organic nitrogen concentrations, coupled with a
    long-term annual increase in salinity and a long-term seasonal increase in
    water temperature are likely to promote additional brown tide blooms in this
    system in the future.
