    A new approach to the analysis of long-term surface water-quality data is
    proposed and implemented. The goal of this approach is to increase the
    amount of information that is extracted from the types of rich water-quality
    datasets that now exist. The method is formulated to allow for maximum
    ﬂexibility in representations of the long-term trend, seasonal components,
    and discharge-related components of the behavior of the water-quality
    variable of interest. It is designed to provide internally consistent
    estimates of the actual history of concentrations and ﬂuxes as well as
    histories that eliminate the inﬂuence of year-to-year variations in
    streamﬂow. The method employs the use of weighted regressions of
    concentrations on time, discharge, and season. Finally, the method is
    designed to be useful as a diagnostic tool regarding the kinds of changes
    that are taking place in the watershed related to point sources, groundwater
    sources, and surface-water nonpoint sources. The method is applied to
    datasets for the nine large tributaries of Chesapeake Bay from 1978 to 2008.
    The results show a wide range of patterns of change in total phosphorus and
    in dissolved nitrate plus nitrite. These results should prove useful in
    further examination of the causes of changes, or lack of changes, and may
    help inform decisions about future actions to reduce nutrient enrichment in
    the Chesapeake Bay and its watershed.

    We study the coverage properties of Bayesian conﬁdence intervals for the
    smooth component functions of generalized additive models (GAMs) represented
    using any penalized regression spline approach. The intervals are the usual
    generalization of the intervals ﬁrst proposed by Wahba and Silverman in 1983
    and 1985, respectively, to the GAM component context. We present simulation
    evidence showing these intervals have close to nominal ‘across-the-function’
    frequentist coverage probabilities, except when the truth is close to a
    straight line/plane function. We extend the argument introduced by Nychka in
    1988 for univariate smoothing splines to explain these results. The
    theoretical argument suggests that close to nominal coverage probabilities
    can be achieved, provided that heavy oversmoothing is avoided, so that the
    bias is not too large a proportion of the sampling variability. The
    theoretical results allow us to derive alternative intervals from a purely
    frequentist point of view, and to explain the impact that the neglect of
    smoothing parameter variability has on conﬁdence interval performance. They
    also suggest switching the target of inference for component-wise intervals
    away from smooth components in the space of the GAM identiﬁability
    constraints.

  abstract: "Abstract\n            Understanding the lag time between land management and impacts on riverine nitrate–nitrogen (N) loads is critical to understand when action to mitigate nitrate–N leaching losses from the soil profile may start improving water quality. These lags occur due to leaching of nitrate–N through the subsurface (soil and groundwater). Actions to mitigate nitrate–N losses have been mandated in New Zealand policy to start showing improvements in water quality within five years. We estimated annual rates of nitrate–N leaching and annual nitrate–N loads for 77 river catchments from 1990 to 2018. Lag times between these losses and riverine loads\_were determined for 34 catchments but could not be determined in other catchments because they exhibited little change in nitrate–N leaching losses or loads. Lag times varied from 1 to 12\_years according to factors like catchment size (Strahler stream order and altitude) and slope. For eight catchments where additional\_isotope and modelling data were available, the mean transit time for surface water at baseflow to pass through the catchment was on average 2.1\_years less than, and never greater than, the mean lag time for nitrate–N, inferring our lag time estimates were robust. The median lag time for nitrate–N across the 34 catchments was 4.5\_years, meaning that nearly half of these catchments wouldn’t exhibit decreases in nitrate–N because of practice change within the five years outlined in policy."

    Generalized additive models represented using low rank penalized regression
    splines, estimated by penalized likelihood maximisation and with smoothness
    selected by generalized cross validation or similar criteria, provide a
    computationally efﬁcient general framework for practical smooth modelling.
    Various authors have proposed approximate Bayesian interval estimates for
    such models, based on extensions of the work of Wahba, G. (1983) [Bayesian
    conﬁdence intervals for the cross validated smoothing spline. J. R. Statist.
    Soc. B 45, 133–150] and Silverman, B.W. (1985) [Some aspects of the spline
    smoothing approach to nonparametric regression curve ﬁtting. J. R. Statist.
    Soc. B 47, 1–52] on smoothing spline models of Gaussian data, but testing of
    such intervals has been rather limited and there is little supporting theory
    for the approximations used in the generalized case. This paper aims to
    improve this situation by providing simulation tests and obtaining
    asymptotic results supporting the approximations employed for the
    generalized case. The simulation results suggest that while across-the-model
    performance is good, component-wise coverage probabilities are not as
    reliable. Since this is likely to result from the neglect of smoothing
    parameter variability, a simple and efﬁcient simulation method is proposed
    to account for smoothing parameter uncertainty: this is demonstrated to
    substantially improve the performance of component-wise intervals.
